## About

My goal is continuous development through learning.
My interests range from natural science disciplines such as chemistry and biology to humanitarian disciplines such as history and sociology. 
Of particular interest is web development, which I devote a lot of free time to.
Among my qualities I can single out as persistence in solving problems, quick search and analysis of information.
